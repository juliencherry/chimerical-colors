# Chimerical Colors

[Colors are horribly, horribly complicated.](https://juliencherry.net/post/146059450673/) Not only are human eyes differentially sensitive to different wavelengths, some colors just can’t be seen under normal circumstances. These are impossible colors, a subset of which are called [chimerical colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color#Chimerical_colors).

You can view chimerical colors by staring at one color long enough to tire out your cone cells, then immediately looking at another color. So let’s try it!
